# wordleBot
## Simple wordle solving algorithm
After running the program, it will output the word one should guess. The user must enter this word into wordle, and then enter a string of 5 characters into the console.
This string should follow the following format:
* Use 'w' to indicate that a character is not in the word (wordle will output this as grey)
* Use 'y' to indicate that a character is in the word but not in the right spot
* use 'g' to indicate that a character is in the right spot
The algorithm will take this information and use it to estimate what the next word one should guess.
